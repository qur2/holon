This is the next shot for a reaktor client library.
It gives you
- a singleton reaktor object
- a reaktor object singleton to the current thread (purpose of this gets explained later)
- or you can just instantiate your own reaktor object
For signatures of a reaktor object see http://txtr.com/reaktor/api/
Ask questions to sascha.dieckmann@txtr.com
